## üì¶ What's Been Created

### Core Files

#### 1. **diffusion.py** - The Heart of Diffusion

  ```
- **Reverse diffusion**: Iteratively removes noise to generate images
- Noise schedules: Linear and cosine variance schedules
- Pre-computed values for efficient sampling

- **QUICKSTART.md**: Hands-on learning path with experiments
- **requirements.txt**: All Python dependencies

## üîë Key Concepts Implemented

### 1. Forward Diffusion (Adding Noise)
- **Purpose**: Define a process that gradually destroys information
- **Method**: Add Gaussian noise over T=1000 steps
- **Math**: Uses reparameterization trick for efficient computation
- **No Training**: This is a fixed mathematical process

### 2. Reverse Diffusion (Denoising)
- **Purpose**: Learn to reverse the noise addition
- **Method**: Train U-Net to predict noise at each step
- **Sampling**: Start from noise, iteratively denoise
- **Training**: Minimize MSE between predicted and actual noise

### 3. Noise Schedules
- **Beta schedule**: Controls how much noise to add at each step
- **Linear**: Simple, works well for images
- **Cosine**: More stable for longer diffusion
- **Alpha cumulative product**: Efficient forward diffusion

### 4. Time Conditioning
- **Why**: Model needs to know current noise level
- **How**: Sinusoidal embeddings of timestep
- **Architecture**: Injected into U-Net blocks

### 5. U-Net Architecture
- **Encoder**: Extracts features at multiple scales
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs with skip connections
- **Skip Connections**: Preserve spatial details
- **Time Embeddings**: Condition on current timestep

## üéì Learning Progression

### Advanced Level (Future)
Explore:
- Latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion approach)
- Text conditioning
- Score-based models
- Consistency models
- Flow matching

- Quality: Recognizable digits, some blur
- Good enough to understand concepts

### After 50 Epochs (~25 min CPU)

- Quality: Clear, sharp digits
- Good diversity in generated samples

### After 100 Epochs (~50 min CPU)
- Loss: ~0.01-0.02

- Excellent diversity

## üß™ Experiments You Can Run

1. **Different timesteps**: Try T=500 or T=2000
2. **Model sizes**: Change base_channels (32, 64, 128)
3. **Learning rates**: Try 1e-4, 2e-4, 5e-4
4. **Batch sizes**: Test 64, 128, 256
5. **Noise schedules**: Compare linear vs cosine
6. **Datasets**: MNIST vs Fashion-MNIST

## üîç Code Architecture

```
Training Loop:
1. Get batch of clean images
2. Sample random timesteps t
3. Add noise: x_t = forward_diffusion(x_0, t, noise)
4. Predict: noise_pred = model(x_t, t)
5. Loss: MSE(noise_pred, noise)
6. Backprop and update

Sampling Loop:
1. Start: x_T ~ N(0, I)  # pure noise
2. For t from T to 1:
   - Predict noise: Œµ = model(x_t, t)
   - Compute mean: Œº = (x_t - Œ≤_t * Œµ) / ‚àöŒ±_t
   - Add noise: x_{t-1} = Œº + ‚àöŒ≤_t * z
3. Return: x_0  # generated image
```

## üí° Why This Approach Works

1. **Gradual Process**: Easier to learn small denoising steps than full generation
2. **Single Model**: One U-Net handles all noise levels with time conditioning
3. **Noise Prediction**: More stable than directly predicting clean images
4. **High Quality**: Can generate very realistic images
5. **Stable Training**: MSE loss is simple and effective

## üéâ Congratulations!

You've built a complete diffusion model from scratch! This is the same fundamental approach used in:
- Stable Diffusion
- DALL-E 2
- Midjourney
- Imagen

The main differences in those systems are:
- Larger models (billions vs millions of parameters)
- More data (billions vs thousands of images)
- Additional conditioning (text, etc.)
- Latent space (work on compressed representations)
- Better sampling methods

But the core idea? The same as what you just built! üöÄ
